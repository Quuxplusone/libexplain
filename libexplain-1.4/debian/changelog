  * Emanuel Haupt <ehaupt@critical.ch> reported several problems building
    libexplain on FreeBSD.  These have been fixed.
  * Note that many of the tests will fail when run in chroot jails, because when
    libexplain is asking for a process's cwd via lsof(1), it gets "/usr -- home/
    jails/portjail/tmp/libexplain-nnnn" instead of "/tmp/libexplain-nnnn". This
    leads libexplain to conclude that it should use the absolute path form of
    the directory name, not ".", which then does not match the expected output.

  * Some tests are difficult because the Debian build environment can vary
    widely.  Sometimes it's a chroot, sometimes it's a VM, sometimes it's
    fakeroot, sometimes it really is running as root.  All these affect the
    ability of the library to probe the system looking for the proximal cause of
    the error, e.g. the error in question ENOSPC.  This often results in 2 or 4
    or 8 acceptable explanations of an error, depending on what the library
    finds, e.g. existence of useful information in the mount table, or not.
