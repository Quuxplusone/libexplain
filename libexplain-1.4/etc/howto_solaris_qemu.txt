0. create disc image

   qemu-img create -f qcow osol.img 20G

1. boot CD and install

   qemu -m 512 -hda /home/vault/osol.img \
       -cdrom /home/vault/iso/osol-0906-x86.iso -boot d \
       -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user

2. reboot from disk image

   qemu -m 512 -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user /home/vault/osol.img

3. once booted, you can grab the tarball using scp

   scp 10.0.2.2:work/libexplain.x.y.Cnnn/web-site/libexplain-x.y.Cnnn.tar.gz .

   then ./configure && make as usual.
   Don't expect naive build speeds.
