0. Create the build environment

   sudo pbuilder --create

1. After building D001 you need to build the software as yourself, in a
   Debian Sid chroot, using pbuilder.

   aecd -bl -p libexplain.cur
   sudo pbuilder --build web-site/debian/*.D001-1.dsc

2. The results need to be signed

   mkdir /tmp/d
   cp /var/cache/pbuilder/result/*explain*D001* /tmp/d
   # watch out for previous releases
   cd /tmp/d
   debsign *.changes

3. Now upload the files to Debian

   dput *.changes
   cd
   rm -rf /tmp/d

   (Note that .dput.cf has default_host_main=ftp-master set, NOT ubuntu.)

4. You should receive an email acknowledging the upload within 24 hours.
   To stop the "Debian: Closes: NNNN" lines being carried forward,
   use the following command:

   aeca aemakegen:debian:accepted=true --delta 1
