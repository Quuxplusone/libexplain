.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by
the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) function has two implementations.
The System V version has no arguments, while the BSD version has two
arguments.  For simplicity of implementation, the argument list seen
here includes the \f[I]pid\fP and \f[I]pgid\fP arguments.
.PP
The System V \f[CW]getpgid()\fP semantics can be obtained by calling
\f[CW]setpgrp(0, 0)\fP on systems with the BSD version, and this is the
API for libexplain, even on systems that do not use the BSD API.

.ad b
.PP
The \f[B]explain_setpgrp\fP function is used to obtain an explanation of an
error returned by the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call. The least the message
will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will
do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value to
be decoded.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pid\fP
The original pid, exactly as passed to the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pgid\fP
The original pgid, exactly as passed to the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.
This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain function which
shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a
return buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\fP This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar
to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.fi
.ad l
if (setpgrp(pid, pgid) < 0)
.ad b
.nf
{
.fi

.in +4n

The \f[B]explain_errno_setpgrp\fP function is used to obtain an explanation
of an error returned by the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call. The least the
message will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually
it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called. This is necessary if
you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of
\f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pid\fP
The original pid, exactly as passed to the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call.

The original pgid, exactly as passed to the \f[I]setpgrp\fP(2) system call.
