.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtains explanations for
\f[I]lstat\fP(2) errors.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_lstat
const char *explain_lstat(const char *pathname, const struct stat *buf);
.PP
The explain_lstat function is used to obtain an explanation of an
error returned by the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) function.  The least the message
will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it
will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value
to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (lstat(pathname, &buf) < 0)
{
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', explain_lstat(pathname, &buf));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The original pathname, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]buf\fP
The original buf, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errno_lstat
"const char *explain_errno_lstat(int errnum, const char *pathname,
const struct stat *buf);
.PP
The explain_errno_lstat function is used to obtain an explanation
of an error returned by the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) function.  The least the
message will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but
usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
more detail.

    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called.  This is necessary
if you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be
explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the
value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The original pathname, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]buf\fP
The original buf, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.

buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.

.SS explain_message_lstat
void explain_message_lstat(char *message, int message_size,

    explain_message_lstat(message, sizeof(message), pathname, &buf);

\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The original pathname, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) system call.

\f[I]buf\fP
The original buf, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lstat\fP(2) system call.
