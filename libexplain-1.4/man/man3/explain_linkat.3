.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for errors returned by
the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system call.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_linkat
.ad l
const char *explain_linkat(int old_fildes, const char *old_path, int
new_fildes, const char *new_path, int flags);
.ad b
.PP
The \f[B]explain_linkat\fP function is used to obtain an explanation of an
error returned by the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system call. The least the message
will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will
do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value to
be decoded.
.TP 8n
\f[I]old_fildes\fP
The original old_fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system
call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]old_path\fP
The original old_path, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system
call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]new_fildes\fP
The original new_fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system
call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]new_path\fP
The original new_path, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system
call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]flags\fP
The original flags, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error. This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument list.
This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain function which
shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a
return buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\fP This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar
to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.fi
.ad l
if (linkat(old_fildes, old_path, new_fildes, new_path, flags) < 0)
.ad b
.nf
{
.fi
.ad l
.in +4n
fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", explain_linkat(old_fildes, old_path, new_fildes,
new_path, flags));
.in -4n
.nf
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.ad b

.PP
The above code example is available pre\-packaged as the
\f[I]explain_linkat_or_die\fP(3) function.

.PP
The \f[B]explain_errno_linkat\fP function is used to obtain an explanation
of an error returned by the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system call. The least the
message will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually
it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called. This is necessary if
you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter the value of
\f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]old_fildes\fP
The original old_fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system
call.

\f[I]old_path\fP
The original old_path, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system
call.

The original new_fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system

The original flags, exactly as passed to the \f[I]linkat\fP(2) system call.
