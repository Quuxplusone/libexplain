.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for
errors returned by the \f[I]ferror\fP(3) system call.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_ferror
const char *explain_ferror(FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_ferror\fP function is
used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the \f[I]ferror\fP(3)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the
value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will
do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more
detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain
the error value to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (ferror(fp) < 0)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", explain_ferror(fp));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.PP
It is essential that this function cal be placed as close as
possible to the I/O code that has caused the problem, otherwise
intervening code could have altered the \f[I]errno\fP global
variable.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]ferror\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is
shared by all libexplain functions which do not supply a
buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten
by the next call to any libexplain function which shares
this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it
shares a return buffer across all threads, and many other
functions in this library.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errno_ferror
const char *explain_errno_ferror(int errnum, FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_errno_ferror\fP function
is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by
the \f[I]ferror\fP(3) system call.
The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but usually it will do much
better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

intervening code could have altered the \f[I]errno\fP global
variable.
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from
the \f[I]errno\fP global variable just before this
function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call
\f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter
the value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]ferror\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n

shared by all libexplain functions which do not supply a

functions in this library.

.SS explain_message_ferror
void explain_message_ferror(char *message, int message_size, FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_message_ferror\fP
function may be used to  obtain an explanation of an error
returned by the
\f[I]ferror\fP(3) system call.
The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will do much
better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain
the error value to be decoded.

This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS

{
    char message[3000];
    explain_message_ferror(message, sizeof(message), fp);

\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.
If a suitable message return buffer is supplied, this
function is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to
store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]ferror\fP(3) system call.
