.SH NAME
explain_pathconf_or_die \- get configuration values and report errors
.if require_index \{
.XX "explain_pathconf_or_die(3)" \
    "get configuration values for files and report errors"
.\}
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/pathconf.h>
.sp 0.3
long explain_pathconf_or_die(const char *pathname, int name);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]explain_pathconf_or_die\fP function
is used to call the \f[I]pathconf\fP(3) system
call.  On failure an explanation will be
printed to \f[I]stderr\fP,
obtained from \f[I]explain_pathconf\fP(3),
and then the process terminates
by calling \f[CW]exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fP.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
long value = explain_pathconf_or_die(pathname, name);
.fi
.ft R
.RE
Note that a \[mi]1 return value is still possible,
meaning the system does not have a limit for the requested resource.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The pathname, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]pathconf\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]name\fP
The name, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]pathconf\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
This function only returns on success.
On failure, prints an explanation and exits.
