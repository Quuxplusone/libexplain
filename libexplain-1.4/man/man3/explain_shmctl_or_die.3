.SH NAME
explain_shmctl_or_die \- shared memory control and report errors
.if require_index \{
.XX "explain_shmctl_or_die(3)" \
    "shared memory control and report errors"
.\}
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/shmctl.h>
.sp 0.3
void explain_shmctl_or_die(int shmid, int command, struct shmid_ds *data);
.br
int explain_shmctl_on_error(int shmid, int command, struct shmid_ds *data);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]explain_shmctl_or_die\fP function is used to call the
\f[I]shmctl\fP(2) system call. On failure an explanation will be printed to
\f[I]stderr\fP, obtained from the \f[I]explain_shmctl\fP(3) function, and
then the process terminates by calling \f[CW]exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fP.
.PP
The \f[B]explain_shmctl_on_error\fP function is used to call the
\f[I]shmctl\fP(2) system call. On failure an explanation will be printed to
\f[I]stderr\fP, obtained from the \f[I]explain_shmctl\fP(3) function, but
still returns to the caller.
.TP 8n
\f[I]shmid\fP
The shmid, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]shmctl\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]command\fP
The command, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]shmctl\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]data\fP
The data, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]shmctl\fP(2) system call.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The \f[B]explain_shmctl_or_die\fP function only returns on success, see
\f[I]shmctl\fP(2) for more information. On failure, prints an explanation
and exits, it does not return.
.PP
The \f[B]explain_shmctl_on_error\fP function always returns the value
return by the wrapped \f[I]shmctl\fP(2) system call.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SH EXAMPLE
The \f[B]explain_shmctl_or_die\fP function is intended to be used in a
fashion similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
explain_shmctl_or_die(shmid, command, data);
.fi
.ft R
.RE
