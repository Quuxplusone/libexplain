.SH NAME
explain_ioctl_or_die \- control device and report errors
.if require_index \{
.XX "explain_ioctl_or_die(3)" \
    "control device and report errors"
.\}
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/ioctl.h>
.sp 0.3
int explain_ioctl_or_die(int fildes, int request, void *data);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]explain_ioctl_or_die\fP function
is used to call the \f[I]ioctl\fP(2) system
call.  On failure an explanation will be
printed to \f[I]stderr\fP,
obtained from \f[I]explain_ioctl\fP(3),
and then the process terminates
by calling \f[CW]exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fP.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
int result = explain_ioctl_or_die(fildes, request, data);
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The fildes, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]ioctl\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]request\fP
The request, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]ioctl\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]data\fP
The data, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]ioctl\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
This function only returns on success, see \f[I]ioctl\fP(2) for more
information.  On failure, prints an explanation and exit()s.
