.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for
errors returned by the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_fputc
const char *explain_fputc(int c, FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_fputc\fP function is
used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by the \f[I]fputc\fP(3)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the
value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will
do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more
detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain
the error value to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (fputc(c, fp) == EOF)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", explain_fputc(c, fp));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]c\fP
The original c, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is
shared by all libexplain functions which do not supply a
buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten
by the next call to any libexplain function which shares
this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it
shares a return buffer across all threads, and many other
functions in this library.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errno_fputc
const char *explain_errno_fputc(int errnum, int c, FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_errno_fputc\fP function
is used to obtain an explanation of an error returned by
the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.
The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but usually it will do much
better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi

.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from
the \f[I]errno\fP global variable just before this
function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call
\f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter
the value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]c\fP
The original c, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.

.SS explain_message_fputc
void explain_message_fputc(char *message, int message_size, int c, FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_message_fputc\fP
function may be used to  obtain an explanation of an error
returned by the
\f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.

The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain
the error value to be decoded.

\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.
If a suitable message return buffer is supplied, this
function is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to
store the returned message.

\f[I]c\fP
The original c, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fputc\fP(3) system call.
