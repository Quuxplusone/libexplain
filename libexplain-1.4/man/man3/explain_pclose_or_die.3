.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/pclose.h>

int explain_pclose_or_die(FILE *fp);

int explain_pclose_success(FILE *fp);

void explain_pclose_success_or_die(FILE *fp);
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to wait for program termination,
and then reprt errors returned by the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_pclose_or_die
int explain_pclose_or_die(FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_pclose_or_die\fP function
is used to call the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system
call.  On failure an explanation will be
printed to \f[I]stderr\fP,
obtained from \f[I]explain_pclose\fP(3),
and then the process terminates
by calling \f[CW]exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fP.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
int status = explain_pclose_or_die(fp);
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The fp, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
This function only returns on success, see \f[I]pclose\fP(3) for more
information.  On failure, prints an explanation and exits.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_pclose_success_or_die
void explain_pclose_success_or_die(FILE *);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_pclose_success_or_die\fP function is used to call
the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.  On failure, including any exit
status other than EXIT_SUCCESS, an explanation will be printed to
\f[I]stderr\fP, obtained from \f[I]explain_pclose\fP(3), and then the
process terminates by calling \f[CW]exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fP.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
explain_pclose_success_or_die(fp);
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The fp, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
This function only returns on success.
On failure, prints an explanation and exits.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_pclose_success
int explain_pclose_success(FILE *fp);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_pclose_success\fP function is used to call
the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.  On failure, including any exit
status other than EXIT_SUCCESS, an explanation will be printed to
\f[I]stderr\fP, obtained from \f[I]explain_pclose\fP(3).
However, the priniting of an error message does \f[B]not\fP
also cause \f[I]exit\fP(2) to be called.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
int status = explain_pclose_success(command);
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The fp, exactly as to be passed to the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
the value returned by the \f[I]pclose\fP(3) system call.
In all cases other than EXIT_SUCCESS, an error message will also have
been printed to stderr.
