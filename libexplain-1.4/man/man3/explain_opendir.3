.SH NAME
explain_opendir \- explain opendir(3) errors
.if require_index \{
.XX "explain_opendir(3)" "explain opendir(3) errors"
.\}
.SH SYNOPSIS
const char *explain_opendir(const char *pathname);
.br
const char *explain_errno_opendir(int errnum, const char *pathname);
int errnum, const char *pathname);
.br
void explain_message_opendir(char *message, int message_size,
.br
void explain_message_errno_opendir(char *message, int message_size,
const char *pathname);
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to explain \f[I]opendir\fP(3) errors.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_opendir
const char *explain_opendir(const char *pathname);
.PP
The explain_opendir function is used to obtain an explanation of
an error returned by the \f[I]opendir\fP(3) function.  The least the
message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value
to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
DIR *dp = opendir(pathname);
if (!dp)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", explain_opendir(pathname));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The original pathname,
exactly as passed to the \f[I]opendir\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \fBnot\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errno_opendir
const char *explain_errno_opendir(int errnum, const char *pathname);
int errnum, const char *pathname);
.PP
The explain_errno_opendir function is used to obtain an explanation
of an error returned by the \f[I]opendir\fP(3) function. The least the
message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it
will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
DIR *dp = opendir(pathname);
if (!dp)
{
    int errnum = errno;
    const char *message = explain_errno_opendir(errnum, pathname);
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", message);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called. This is necessary
if you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be
explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the
value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The original pathname, exactly as passed to the \f[I]opendir\fP(3)
system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.

    explain_message_opendir(message, sizeof(message), pathname);

.TP 8n
\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe if the
buffer is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]pathname\fP
The original pathname, exactly as passed to the \f[I]opendir\fP(3) system call.

\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe if the
buffer is thread safe.

The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called.  This is necessary
