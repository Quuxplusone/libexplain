void explain_execve_or_die(const char *pathname, const char *const *argv,
const char *const *envp);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]explain_execve_or_die\fP function
is used to call the \f[I]execve\fP(2) system
call.  On failure an explanation will be
printed to \f[I]stderr\fP,
obtained from \f[I]explain_execve\fP(3),
and then the process terminates
by calling \f[CW]exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fP.
.PP

similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW

explain_execve_or_die(pathname, argv, envp);
.fi
.ft R

.TP 8n
\f[I]envp\fP
