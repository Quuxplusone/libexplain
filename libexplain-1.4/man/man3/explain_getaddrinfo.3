explain_getaddrinfo \- explain getaddrinfo(3) errors
.if require_index \{
.XX "explain_getaddrinfo(3)" "explain getaddrinfo(3) errors"

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/getaddrinfo.h>
.sp 0.3
const char *explain_errcode_getaddrinfo(int errnum, const char *node,
const char *service, const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **res);

void explain_message_errcode_getaddrinfo(char *message, int message_size,
int errnum, const char *node, const char *service, const struct addrinfo *hints,
struct addrinfo **res);
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for
errors returned by the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errcode_getaddrinfo
const char *explain_errcode_getaddrinfo(int errnum, const char *node,
const char *service, const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **res);
.PP
The \f[B]explain_errcode_getaddrinfo\fP function is used to obtain
an explanation of an error returned by the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]gai_strerror(errcode)\fP, but usually it will do much better, and
indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
int errcode = getaddrinfo(node, service, hints, res);
if (errncode == GAI_SYSTEM)
    errcode = errno;
if (errcode)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", explain_errcode_getaddrinfo(errcode,
        node, service, hints, res));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.PP
The above code example is available as the
\f[I]explain_getaddrinfo_or_die\fP(3) function.
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from
the \f[I]errno\fP global variable just before this
function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call
\f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter
the value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]node\fP
The original node, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]service\fP
The original service, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3)
system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]hints\fP
The original hints, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]res\fP
The original res, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is
shared by all libexplain functions which do not supply a
buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten
by the next call to any libexplain function which shares
this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it
shares a return buffer across all threads, and many other
functions in this library.

.SS explain_message_errno_getaddrinfo
void explain_message_errno_getaddrinfo(char *message, int message_size,
int errnum, const char *node, const char *service, const struct addrinfo *hints,

.PP
The \f[B]explain_message_errno_getaddrinfo\fP
function may be used to obtain an explanation of an error
returned by the
\f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but usually it will do much
better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:

int errcode = getaddrinfo(node, service, hints, res);
if (errnode == EAI_SYSTEM)
    errcode = errno;
if (errcode)
{
    char message[3000];
    explain_message_errcode_getaddrinfo(message, sizeof(message),
        errcode, node, service, hints, res);

The above code example is available pre\[hy]packaged
as the \f[I]explain_getaddrinfo_or_die\fP(3) function.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.
If a suitable message return buffer is supplied, this
function is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to
store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from
the \f[I]errno\fP global variable just before this
function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call
\f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter
the value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]node\fP
The original node, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]service\fP
The original service, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3)
system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]hints\fP
The original hints, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]res\fP
The original res, exactly as passed to the \f[I]getaddrinfo\fP(3) system call.
