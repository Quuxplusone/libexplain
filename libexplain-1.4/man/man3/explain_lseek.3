.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/lseek.h>
.br
const char *explain_lseek(int fildes, long long offset, int whence);
.br
const char *explain_errno_lseek(int errnum, int fildes, long long offset,
int whence);
.br
void explain_message_lseek(char *message, int message_size, int fildes,
long long offset, int whence);
.br
void explain_message_errno_lseek(char *message, int message_size,
int errnum, int fildes, long long offset, int whence);
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations
for \f[I]lseek\fP(2) errors.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_lseek
const char *explain_lseek(int fildes, long long offset, int whence);
.PP
The explain_lseek function may be used to obtain a human readable
explanation of what went wrong in an \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.  The
least the message will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP,
but usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value
to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (lseek(fd, offset, whence) == (off_t)\-1)
{
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', explain_lseek(fd, offset, whence);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]offset\fP
The original offset,
exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]whence\fP
The original whence,
exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errno_lseek
const char *explain_errno_lseek(int errnum, int fildes, long long offset,
int whence);
.PP
The explain_errno_lseek function may be used to obtain a human
readable explanation of what went wrong in an \f[I]lseek\fP(2)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but usually it will do much better, and
indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (lseek(fd, offset, whence) == (off_t)\-1)
{
    int errnum = errno;
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', explain_errno_lseek(fd, eernum, offset,
        whence);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called.  This is necessary
if you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be
explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the
value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.
.br
\f[I]offset\fP
The original offset, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.

\f[I]whence\fP
The original whence, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.

void explain_message_lseek(char *message, int message_size, int fildes,

\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.

\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]lseek\fP(2) system call.

The original offset,
