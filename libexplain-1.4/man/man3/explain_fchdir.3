#include <libexplain/fchdir.h>
.br
const char *explain_fchdir(int fildes);
.br
void explain_message_fchdir(char *message, int message_size, int fildes);

const char *explain_errno_fchdir(int errnum, int fildes);

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for
\f[I]fchdir\fP(2) errors.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_fchdir
const char *explain_fchdir(int fildes);
.PP
The explain_fchdir function is used to obtain an explanation of an
error returned by the \f[I]fchdir\fP(2) system call.  The least the
message will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but
usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value
to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (fchdir(fildes) < 0)
{
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', explain_fchdir(fildes));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fchdir\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS explain_errno_fchdir
const char *explain_errno_fchdir(int errnum, int fildes);
.PP
The explain_errno_fchdir function is used to obtain an explanation
of an error returned by the \f[I]fchdir\fP(2) system call.  The least
the message will contain is the value of \f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but
usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
more detail.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (fchdir(fildes) < 0)
{
    int err = errno;
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', explain_errno_fchdir(err, fildes));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called.  This is necessary
if you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be
explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the
value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fchdir\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.

    char message[3000];
    explain_message_fchdir(message, sizeof(message), fildes);

.TP 8n
\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe.
.TP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fchdir\fP(2) system call.
