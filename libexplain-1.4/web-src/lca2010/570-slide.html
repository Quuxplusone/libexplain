ENOSPC, No space left on device

<table align="center" width=800 ><tr><td>
When a user reports ENOSPC, the first thing the sysadmin want to know is
the mount point, and the user says &ldquo;what's that?&rdquo;
<blockquote><tt>
write(fildes = 1 "example", data = 0xbfff2340, data_size = 5)
failed, No space left on device (28, ENOSPC) because the file system
containing fildes ("/home") has no more space for data
