This code:
<blockquote><pre>
int fd = explain_open_or_die("some/thing", O_RDONLY, 0);
</pre></blockquote>
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
produces this message:
<blockquote><pre>
open(pathname = "some/file", flags = O_RDONLY) failed,
No such file or directory (2, ENOENT) because there is
no "some" directory in the current directory
</pre></blockquote>
</td></tr>

This breaks down into three pieces:
<blockquote>
<i>system-call</i> <tt>failed,</tt>
<i>system-error</i> <tt>because</tt>
<i>explanation</i>
