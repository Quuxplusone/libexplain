Strange and Interesting System Calls<br/>
EFAULT, Bad address
</h1>

<table align="center" ><tr><td>
If a system call only has one pointer argument, it is easy to figure out.
<blockquote><pre>
unlink(pathname = 0x7FFFDB0B49C9) failed, Bad address (14, EFAULT) because
pathname refers to memory that is outside the process's accessible address
space; this is more likely to be a software error (a bug) than it is to be a
user error
</pre></blockquote>
But what if there is more than one pointer argument?
<blockquote><pre>
rename(oldpath = "fred", newpath = 0x7FFFDB0B49C9) failed, Bad address (14,
EFAULT) because newpath refers to memory that is outside the process's
accessible address space; this is more likely to be a software error (a bug)
than it is to be a user error
</pre></blockquote>
The library does not disturb process signal handlers.
