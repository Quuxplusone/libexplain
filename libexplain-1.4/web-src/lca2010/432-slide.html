Find the Final Entry
</h1>

<table align="center" width=800 ><tr><td>
The lookup of the final component of the pathname goes just like that
of all other components, with <b>two</b> differences:
<ol start=3 >
<li>
It is also possible to have a problem with the last component if it is a
symbolic link and it should not be followed.
For example, using the <i>open</i>(2) O_NOFOLLOW flag:
<blockquote><tt>
open(pathname = "a-symlink", flags = O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW) failed, Too many
levels of symbolic links (ELOOP) because O_NOFOLLOW was specified but
pathname refers to a symbolic link
</tt></blockquote>
</ol>
