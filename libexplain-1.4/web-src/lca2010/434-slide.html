The lookup of the final component of the pathname goes just like that
of all other components, with two differences:
<ol start=5 >
<li>
The &ldquo;t&rdquo; bit is voodoo:
<blockquote><tt>
unlink(pathname = "/tmp/no-no-no") failed, Operation not permitted (1,
EPERM) because the pathname directory "/tmp" has the sticky
bit (S_ISVTX) set and the process's effective UID (200 "pmiller") is
neither the UID of the file to be deleted (201 "archives") nor that of
the directory (0 "root"), and the process is not
privileged (does not have the DAC_FOWNER capability)
</tt></blockquote>
