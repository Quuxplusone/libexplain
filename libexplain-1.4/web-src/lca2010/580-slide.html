Strange and Interesting System Calls<br/>
EROFS, Read-only file system
</h1>

<table align="center" width=800 ><tr><td>
File systems name the mount point:
<blockquote><tt>
fopen(pathname = "/media/disk/booboo", flags = "w")
failed, Read-only file system (30, EROFS) because write access was
requested and pathname refers to a file on a read-only file system
("/media/disk", 42% full)
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
Devices are slightly different:
<blockquote><tt>
open(pathname = "/dev/fd0", O_RDWR, 0666) failed, Read-only file system
(30, EROFS) because the floppy disk has the write protect tab set
</tt></blockquote>
