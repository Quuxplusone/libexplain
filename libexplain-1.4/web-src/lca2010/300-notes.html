This code:
<blockquote>
int fd = explain_open_or_die("some/thing", O_RDONLY, 0);
</blockquote>
produces this messsage:
<blockquote>
open(pathname = "some/file", flags = O_RDONLY) failed,
No such file or directory (2, ENOENT) because there is
no "some" directory in the current directory
</blockquote>
This breaks down into three pieces:
<blockquote>
<i>system-call</i> failed, <i>system-error</i> because <i>explanation</i>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li> This is the proximal cause.
<li> Developers find it useful.
<li> If not in error message, user can't copy-and-paste into bug report.
<li> Maintainers find that useful (once apon a time, on a file system
     far, far away...)
<li> Arguments names used in explanation for context.
<li> <b>Note:</b> I have been using error messages with this level of detail
     for many years, and they go over rather well, contrary to expectations.
<li> Users like it when you don't talk down to them.
     Give them some credit.

<ul>
<li> This portion attempts to explain the proximal cause of the error in
plain language.
<li> It attempts to include as much information as possible,
<li>possibly delving deeply into the semantics of the system call,
<li>including looking at owners and permission bits.
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Tell me everything.
<li> Including what I didn't know to look for (or <i>how</i> to look for)
<li> Avoid modifying process (thread) state
<li> Absolute paths if relative paths would be ambiguous
