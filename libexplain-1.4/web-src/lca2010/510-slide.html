ENOMEDIUM, No medium found

Copying a CD was the origin of the title of this talk.
<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>dd if=/dev/cdrom of=fubar.iso</b>
dd: opening "/dev/cdrom": No medium found
$
</pre></blockquote>

Of course, you can't find a psychic medium.
But why are you telling me?

<blockquote><pre>
open(pathname = "/dev/cdrom", flags = O_RDONLY) failed, No medium found (123,
ENOMEDIUM) because there does not appear to be a disc in the CD-ROM drive
</pre></blockquote>

This is more informative.
It also groks floppy disks, <i>etc</i>.
