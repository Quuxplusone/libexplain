File System Limits<br/>
Filename Length Limit

<table align="center" width=800 ><tr><td>

Some Unix variants have a limit on the number of bytes in each path
component, and that limit bites.
<blockquote><tt>
open(pathname = "system7/only-had-14-characters", flags = O_RDONLY)
failed, File name too long (36, ENAMETOOLONG)
because "only-had-14-characters" component is longer than the system limit (14)
</tt></blockquote>
Again, the system limit is included in the error message.
