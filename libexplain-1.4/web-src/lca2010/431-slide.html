Find the Final Entry

<table align="center" width=800 ><tr><td>
The lookup of the final component of the pathname goes just like that
of all other components, with two differences:
<ol start=2 >
<li> The final component must not be a directory, unless it must be.
<blockquote><tt>
opendir(pathname = "/home/pmiller/.netrc") failed, Not a directory (20,
ENOTDIR) because in the pathname "/home/pmiller" directory there is a
".netrc" regular file, but it should be a directory
</tt></blockquote>
</ol>
It all depends on the system call.
