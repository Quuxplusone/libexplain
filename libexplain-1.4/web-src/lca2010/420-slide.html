If the process does not have search permission on the current lookup

open(pathname = "/home/archives/.ssh/private_key", flags = O_RDONLY)
failed, Permission denied (13, EACCES) because the process does not
have search permission to the pathname "/home/archives/.ssh" directory,
the process effective GID 1000 "pmiller" does not match the directory
owner 1001 "archives" so the owner permission mode "rwx" is ignored, the
others permission mode is "---", and the process is not privileged
