For each path component that isn't the final component...
<p>
If the component is found and is a symbolic link (symlink), we first
resolve this symbolic link (with the current lookup directory as
starting lookup directory), and re-start this step.
The libexplain library tries to be a little more informative.
<blockquote><tt>
unlink(pathname = "/tmp/dangling/rubbish") failed, No such file or
directory (2, ENOENT) because the "dangling" symbolic link in the pathname
"/tmp" directory refers to "nowhere" that does not exist
