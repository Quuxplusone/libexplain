Find the Final Entry

<table align="center" width=800 ><tr><td>
The lookup of the final component of the pathname goes just like that
of all other components, with two differences:
<ol start=4 >
<li>
It is also possible that the final component is required to be something
other than a regular file:
<blockquote><tt>
readlink(pathname = "just-a-file", data = 0x7F930A50,
data_size = 4097) failed, Invalid argument (22, EINVAL) because pathname is
a regular file, not a symbolic link
</tt></blockquote>
</ol>
