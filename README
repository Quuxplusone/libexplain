This is an unmaintained snapshot of the "libexplain" sources.
The official, maintained source for "libexplain" is located at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/libexplain/

The only reason this GitHub project exists is that I was trying
to find the source for libexplain online, and couldn't find it
except in tarball downloads on SourceForge (which are not browsable
by Web browsers, and not spiderable by search engines).

If you intend to build libexplain from source, please visit
